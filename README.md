# dog_or_cat
 use tensorflow 2.0 to tell a dog and cat from a specified picture
 

This is one of the classic experiments for the introduction of deep learning: the cat and dog classification experiment. We will use tensorflow 2.0 to classify the cats and dogs in the pictures. Due to the limitation of file upload size, I deleted most of the pictures. If you want to obtain the original data set, you can go to https://momodel.cn/explore/60e6b9babb5ba072ad72755d?type=dataset to download it.


In addition, the local model that I use CPU for training has been deleted by me, leaving only one model of others on the network for reference. If you want to improve the experimental accuracy, you can try to increase epochs or improve the model. It is recommended to use GPU to accelerate the model training.
